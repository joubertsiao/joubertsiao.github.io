          <div id="article-body">
            <p>published on Jun-12-2025</p>
             Creating a website isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about crafting an experience. Here’s what I learned while redesigning mine.
            <h2>Rethinking the Purpose of My Website</h2>
                <p>Web design isn’t something you throw together on a whim—it’s a thoughtful, evolving journey. I discovered this firsthand while 
                    reconsidering how my site should look, feel, and function.</p>
                </p>I came to realize that my website should reflect me—not just as a creator, but as a person. It should feel genuine, personal,
                 and full of engaging content—whether written or visual—that visitors can connect with. Ideally, I want someone to land on the 
                 homepage and immediately think:<br/>
                “Ahhh, so this is Jojo Siao…”</p>
                <h2>Designing with Simplicity and Personality</h2>
               <p>To create that kind of impression, I redesigned my index page with a clean, minimalist layout. It acts as a brief introduction
                 to who I am, featuring direct links to my social media platforms.</p>
                <p>From there, visitors can explore my blog—a growing collection of articles that give a deeper look into my thoughts and interests.</p>
                <h2>Making My Blog More Accessible</h2>
                <p>Initially, readers had to click a button and be redirected to another page to access my blog posts. I realized this extra step 
                might discourage engagement.</p>
                <p>To make things easier, I updated the button to smoothly scroll down the homepage itself, where a list of blog articles is now 
                    featured. This small UX change made a big difference—it keeps the experience seamless and encourages exploration.</p>
                <h2>What's Next for the Site?</h2>
                <p>My website is still a work in progress, and I’m excited about what’s coming next. I plan to add more about my hobbies—especially 
                    photography and watercolor painting. These are important parts of who I am, and I look forward to sharing them with you.</p>
                <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>This redesign has been an eye-opening experience. I’ve learned that web design isn’t just about choosing the right colors
                     or layouts—it’s about creating a space that communicates identity and invites interaction. In other words, 
                     it’s a key part of the overall user experience.</p>
                <p>I’m proud of how far the site has come, and I’m even more excited about where it’s going.</p>
                <p>Thanks for stopping by—and stay tuned!</p>
